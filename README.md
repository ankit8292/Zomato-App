This zomato-app project is similar like zomato where user can get some resturant by submiting the city name and dish type
in the search form. After that some resutaurant has been display on the page based on the query.User can see some details 
about restaurant like rating,menu, etc. I am using Zomato api in this project. JavaScript and Bootstrap4 technologies are used 
to build this project.
